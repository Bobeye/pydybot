The example here is serving for the test on ANSWENERGY, a motion kinetic energy collector.

An AX-12A servo is used to generate a serial of vibration movement with specific amplitudes, frequency, etc. In the meanwihle, an arduino Nano is checking the output voltage of the device. The voltage is reported back to PC through serial connection by USB.

The testing platform shows a detialed relation between the output energy of ANSWENERGY motion energy collector and the input vibration. The rusult is a great contribution to the project.
